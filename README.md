## 🌟 Project Overview
Cyclones are one of the most destructive natural disasters, causing immense damage to life and property. Early and accurate prediction is crucial for disaster management and mitigation efforts.  

This project leverages **machine learning** to create a robust system for early cyclone detection. We analyze historical weather data, train several classification models, compare their performance, and deploy the best-performing model in an interactive web application.
